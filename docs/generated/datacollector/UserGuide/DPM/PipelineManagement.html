            from production <span class="ph">Data Collector</span>s.
            That way, you can ensure that published pipelines are only run on production <span class="ph">Data Collector</span>s

            that a developer is currently using to design pipelines. For more information about

    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">If you develop pipelines in a <span class="ph">Data Collector</span> that
        is not registered with <span class="ph">Control Hub</span>, you
        can export the pipelines and then import the pipelines into <span class="ph">Control Hub</span>. When a
            <span class="ph">Data Collector</span> is
        registered with <span class="ph">Control Hub</span>, it's
        simplest to publish the pipelines directly to <span class="ph">Control Hub</span>.</p>

        <div class="section context">
            <p class="p">You
                can export a pipeline for use in <span class="ph">Control Hub</span>
                when the pipeline is valid. You can export a single pipeline or a set of pipelines
                at one time.</p>

            <p class="p">When you export a single pipeline, <span class="ph">Data Collector</span> generates a JSON file named after the pipeline, as follows:
                    <samp class="ph systemoutput">&lt;pipeline name&gt;.json</samp>. The generated JSON file
                includes the definition of each stage library used in the pipeline.</p>

            <p class="p">When you export a set of pipelines, <span class="ph">Data Collector</span> creates a ZIP file named <samp class="ph codeph">pipelines.zip</samp>.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">Data Collector</span>
                saves the files to your default downloads directory.</p>
